PLAN:

dedup: should run on 1 thread, little improvements when increasing amount of threads
ferret: should run on 3 threads 3 cores
canneal: can run 2 threads 2 cores, very little improvement when going from 2 to 3
radix: can be 1 or 2
freqmine: 3 or 2, 30 sec improvement from 3 threads to 2 threads, let it scale like vips
blackscholes: 1 or 2 threads
vips: 3 threads 2 cores, and let it scale if posssible

POSSIBLE SCHEDULE:

ferret (3,3T) -> 2.13 mins
freqmine(3,3T) -> 2.6 mins
canneal (2,2T) + dedup(1) -> 1.83 mins (0.38 mins for dedup)
radix (1,4T) -> hopefully absorbed into above (0.28 mins)
blackscholes (1,3T) -> 0.74 mins (part of it absorbed into canneal)
vips (2,3T -> 3,3T) -> 0.657 mins

BASELINE: based on running the baselines in series

radix, freqmine, canneal, ferret, dedup, blackscholes, vips
0.35 + 2.63 + 1.69 + 2.13 + 0.35 + 0.85 + 0.622 = 8.622 mins (optimal threads/cores, series)
